        <p><b>My name is Maggie Morris.</b> I have two brothers. One is named Kyle, he is 11 years old and goes to Claymont elementary school. My other brother's name is Ryan and he is 16 years old and goes to Sallies. My parents are named Don and Susan, and we have one labradoodle named Daisy who is 13 years old. I have 36 cousins on one side of my family and 6 on my other side.</p>
        <!--A paragraph about my favorite things and the schools i've been to  -->
        <p>I am a freshman at Padua. I do cross country, track, and soccer. In my free time I like to watch movies, go to the beach, and bike. My favorite season is Spring because i like all the flowers. My birthday is July 21st 2004 which is national ice cream day. I went to Mount Pleasant Elementary from kindergarten to thrird grade, Claymont elementary from fourth and fifth grade, and PS DuPont Middle School for sixth through eigth grade.My favorite book is <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i></p> 
        
        <!-- A paragraph about one of my favorite travel spots-->
        <p>Every summer, my family all goes to Acadia National Park in Maine. We all rent campsites right next to eachother for a week and we all hang out together. There is so much to do up there. You can go hiking up massive mountains, swim at the freezing beach, go shopping dowwntown, eat delicious lobster, and so much more. Last year, it poured so much, we barely could do anything outside. Instead we played games in our tents, and fishing when it wasn't that bad out. My favirote quote is</p><blockquote>"A day without laughter is a day wasted"</blockquote>
